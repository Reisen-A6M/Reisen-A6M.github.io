<h3 id="markdown">Naming</h3>

<p>Rabbits living on the moon.</p>

<p>The red pupil implies that she possesses more craziness than the rabbits on the ground.</p>

<p>Now, Reisen is Houraisan Kaguya's pet. Reisen's original name was れいせん or レイセン (Reisen). In order to pretend to be a rabbit living on the ground, she uses the Japanese letters as her name, which seems to be odd.</p>

<p>うどんげいん (Udongein) is the nickname taken by Yagokoro Eirin. But the meaning of it is still unclear. In addition, Eirin will affectionately call her ウドンゲ. (It's really hard to understand the thought of cosmopolitan people if we take a nickname casually and omit it.)</p>

<p>イナバ (Inaba) is the name given by Kaguya because イナバ means all rabbits on the ground. By calling Inaba, she can't distinguish Reisen from the Tewi, but it feels that she just doesn't want them to be distinguished. Perhaps because they're all rabbits, so everything should be the same.</p>

<p>She was a moon rabbit, who escaped from the moon when the people on the earth began to launch a war against the moon. (This is where the name "Fleeing soldier in the Lunar War" or "Lunar Veteran" comes from. </p>

<h3 id="markdown">Ability Related to Waves</h3>

<p>Light is made up of waves - though common sense at first glance, this alone cannot be called a comprehensive perspective.</p>

<p>Space itself is a wave, in which the existence of biological, material, of course, also contains light, are composed of waves.</p>

<p>Of course, biological thinking and feelings are also made up of waves. It is because of different wavelengths that different individuals have different personalities.</p>

<p>Reisen's ability is to manipulate these waves.</p>

<p>If you make the wavelength shorter, you will become crazy; if you make the wavelength longer, you will become calm.</p>

<p>And if it is completely reversed... She will disappear from all the perception of her opponent, and her existence will become imperceptible.</p>

<p>The power of rage (in details)</p>

<p>Manipulation of rage is to make people crazy, is a kind of ability to operate the wavelength of things.</p>

<p>If the wavelength is increased, people will feel lazy and don't want to do anything.</p>

<p>Shorten the wavelength, people will be anxious, emotional become unstable and impulsive, unable to talk.</p>

<p>Increase the amplitude, there will be excess, even if further can convey meaning.</p>

<p>If the amplitude is reduced, the existence will be thinned, even if it is near, the sound will not be conveyed.</p>

<p>When the phase is moved, there will be no interference or touch.</p>

<p>If it becomes the reverse phase, existence will be denied and things will disappear completely.</p>

<p>Reisen can use this magnificent ability to control people's rage.</p>

<h3 id="jekyll-themes">Characteristics</h3>

<p>Craziness and leisure coexist. (<a href="https://thwiki.cc/%E8%83%81%E8%BF%AB%E5%B9%BB%E8%A7%89" target="_blank">Obessessionor</a>) The characteristics are completely different in combat and in daily lives.</p>

<p>Because Reisen is not an earth creature, she seldom cooperates with human beings. Don't be surprised when she changes the characteristics quickly.</p>

<p>Although Reisen is not gentle at all, it occasionally shows a leisurely side similar to Reimu.</p>

<h3 id="jekyll-themes">Other features</h3>

<p>Reisen Udongein Inaba and Tewi Inaba are very different from other monsters, Reisen is a special monster. She has a long, slender body and a good posture, unlike a monster. She's slow comparing to other monsters. She never attack human beings, instead she tries to avoid humans. Reisen has long ears and hair. In general, she's a different monster rabbit.</p>

<p>Tewi Inaba is the leader of the rabbits in the pavilion, whereas Reisen can give orders to Tewi.</p>

<p>It is said that looking into Reisen's red eyes will make people crazy and her voice can't be heard even if you want to listen to it. Conversely, sometimes you can hear her talking in the ear in a long distance. So, it can be hard to communicate with her.</p>

<p>Reisen usually lives in the pavilion, where, her action is unknown. Sometimes she come to the village to sell medicine. She is famous for showing up in the village with a bunch of strange drugs（For example, some bitter medicines).</p>

<h3 id="jekyll-themes"><p>Eyewitness reports</p></h3>

<p>· Shoots by an elderly</p>

<p>It was a matter of picking bamboo shoots early one day. For some reason, most bamboo shoots are very deep. When I got up again, I saw the wonderful monster rabbit.</p>
<p>"The rabbit didn't know why he was talking to the sky, as if she was talking to someone. But there was only the sinking moon in the distance."</p>
<p>"When I couldn't stand the scene and was about to leave, the monster rabbit suddenly turned around and found me."</p>
<p>"And then in a flash she disappeared."</p>
<p>"Am I dreaming?（Old man picking bamboo shoots)"</p>
<p>"Maybe it was a dream（ It could also be the Alzheimer's disease.)"</p>
<p>"This monster rabbit had a mysterious action, there were many unknowns."</p>

<p>· Journalist: Shameimaru Aya</p>

<p>Level 4-1: "Well, is there something wrong with the camera? I always felt that the focal length is not adjusted well at that time. The picture's very blurred."</p>
<p>Level 4-4 (Rocket in Mist): "It seems that sometimes the focus is not right. That's not good. If you don't look through the viewfinder, you can see a little bit... Eh?"</p>
<p>Level 4-6 (Invisible Half Moon): "It seems that it's not the camera fault, but a strange force. I think this can be used as the theme of the report! But the photos are all out of focus."</p>
<p>Level 4-9 (Dream World): "Take a closer look. There is a rabbit. We didn't find it at that time because we paid attention to the abnormal visual field. Can we say that this rabbit was the culprit for the abnormal vision at that time? It can't be true."</p>

<h3 id="jekyll-themes"><p>Countermeasures</p></h3>

<p>There are no reports of this monster attacking people.</p>

<p>But that doesn't mean she's human friendly. When you come to a human village and sell the medicine, you will immediately disappear into the lost bamboo forest. She's like deliberately avoiding humans.</p>

<p>Her diet is the same as human, which is different from ordinary monsters.</p>

<p>One thing we must pay attention to is not to look directly into her red eyes. These eyes have the same effect as the full moon, which makes people mad.</p>
